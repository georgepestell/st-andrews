i think it is safe to say that ours is the only dining room in west los angeles on whose table an eightfootlong twohundredpound behemoth on which i have taken my meals for many years rest piles of photocopies of articles on suicide all of which were printed in the encyclopaedia britannica over the past years they represent the convergence of two crucially important strands in my own life indeed as i look at the articles arrayed before me in fanlike tiers i get the odd feeling that the old oak ruble on which i have eaten so many thousands of dinners has been set not with its customary china and silver but with my intellectual autobiography the high point of my freshmanyear english literature survey course taught by that sweet man and emily dickinson biographer richard sewall came early in the fall struggling through the middle english of the canterbury tales i arrived at the point in the story where the narrator of the poem referred to by critics as chaucer the pilgrim becomes a character in it at the conclusion of the prioress s tale the host notices me for the first time and asks what man artou thou lookest as thou woldest find an hare for evere upon the ground i see thee stare he asks chaucer to contribute a tale of mirth the narrator replies that he knows only a rym i lerned longe agoon this turns out to be the tale of sir thopas a turgid bit of doggerel about an ineffectual and effeminate knight it goes on for a couple of dozen stanzas and then in the middle of a line the host breaks in goddes dignitee by god quod he for plainly at oo one word thy drasty

banks of the hudson river at ossining one of the most prominent causal factors of the seemingly rebounding addiction to supernaturalism as an explanation of the world and justification for action is surely the dramatic rate of social and technological change which often forces people to abandon tradition in order to adapt to entirely new situations in our grandparents day or even our parents what we learned in school was reasonably expected to provide us with useful information for a lifetime no more it has been said that information is doubling every five years with such an exponential curve how can anyone expect to learn it all and cope with its ramifications a computerized block design task was developed which records temporal and nontemporal measures of performance this study evaluates the reliability of the measures and reports their intercorrelations with one exception the measures showed moderate to good reliability the results indicate that increasing the difficulyv of the task and testing a more diverse sample may be necessary for improved reliability a nontemporal method of scoring a blockdesign task would be useful when testing persons who have handicaps affecting motor skills but no central nervous system deficits our purpose in this study is to view theories of psychotherapy from a general socialpolitical context especially insofar as they pertain to values beginning with weisskopfjoelson s thesis that theories of psychotherapy may be perceptual houses with their own unique value structures we studied the values of psychoanalytic psychotherapists within the framework of rokeach s system through the rokeach value survey we examined the values held by a group of psychoanalytic trainees in and those held by a group of practicing psychoanalysts in because neither group of subjects can be regarded as randomly representative of the universe of psychoanalysts we regard the resultant data as evocative and informative rather than definitive nonetheless we examined the extent to which value profiles for the psychoanalytic trainees of were similar or dissimilar to those of practicing psychoanalysts in such comparisons at the least provide some general indication as to whether valu es have shifted in the universe within this time period findings are presented about specific patterns of values and implications are discussed there appears to be we studied lending support to this discipline s designation of a perceptual house insofar as its values are concerned in april i was in japan for a united nations conference held in the industrial city of sendai on the relationship of science and technology to international peace and security on the night before returning to the united states while sleeping in a typical oldstyle japanese inn in kyoto i had a dream on earth day april that reflected my experience of coming back to a country that had been changed drastically from the place that i had once known thirty years ago

she held gospel study classes in pupils homes every wednesday after school i will never forget the day i sat on my front porch watching some twenty or so of my classmates follow miss schneider into the home of my neighbor and best friend just two doors down from me joining the class was the thing to do and i could nt do it i was jewish to be sure with what can only be described as conversionary zeal miss schneider tried regularly to remedy my religious status a project that led my parents to remove me from her classroom by february but in december i was still a miss schneider ward and that is where i encountered christmas as the united states prepares to celebrate the th anniversary of the act of civil disobedience by rosa parks it is critical that any false emphases and flawed cultural myths associated with that december day be challenged and corrected by exploring some of the historicalpolitical social and personal influences that encouraged parks s refusal to move from her bus seat it is possible to recognize in her deed the markings of a true prophetic act before leaving the story of rosa parks one final moment of irony is worthy of mention the montgomery bus boycott lasted for months until the supreme court rejected the segregationist position of the montgomery city commission and ordered that by december all the buses be integrated by law on the morning of december a reporter and photographer from look magazine knocked on rosa parks s door and persuaded her to have her picture taken riding a bus on that first day of integration the famous subsequent photograph showing rosa parks glancing out a window with a white male passenger seated in the row behind her just happened to be taken on a bus driven that day by when the topic of junior achievement

problem with manseau s article is not really with the debate over first freedom but with his comment quoted above the first amendment has nothing to do with freedom from religion any more than it has to do with limitations on churches or citizens but with the limitation placed on congress with regard to religion congress can neither enforce a federal church upon americans nor can it rob people of their right to express their religion in any way they choose or in no way at all the problem with people like manseau has to do with their failure to interpret history on century secular mindset on

frank robinson s pulp culture here he offers usa textbook example of how to get ahead in advertising who writes these textbooks anyway the field representative of the demon showed up exactly thirty days before pete whitlock s fiftyfifth birthday he assumed human form for the visit appearing as a handsome tanned young man in his late twenties how you doing pete he inquired just after materializing in the doorway of pete s den at a few minutes after two on an overcast afternoon in late october pete had been hunched at his computer keyboard trying to beef up his resume i ve decided not to sell he told the young man looking up so if you re with one of the realtors who name s chip willis the demon s rep held out a completely believable hand i m not in real estate getting up pete shook hands from the bank they mentioned they were going to send somebody over about the equity loan he said see i ve decided to keep the house for a while borrow on it and hold on until i get the new advertising job i m waiting for good plan pete willis settled into the big brown armchair wo nt make much difference in the long haul but you may as well go out hopefully frowning pete asked you are nt from the bank hope but it s a natural mistake willis smiled broadly i ve got myself rigged to suggest something like that sincerity financial stability could be a lawyer maybe an accountant you know someone people will trust hell are you then why did you walk right into my house did nt walk in sport corrected the smiling willis i materialized you must ve heard the faint popping sound it s caused by the displacement of great wonderful i do nt have enough problems now i have a lunatic prowling my keep cool there s no problem i m not a loon a serial killer or any other common suburban bugaboo go away suggested pete if you re a burglar i have to tell you right off that not a burglar either no his smile broadened well what say we get down to business what business i do nt far as i know have any impending business at all with a lunatic hey pete you re not paying close enough attention here did nt i just listen to me now a briefcase appeared suddenly on his lap a brand new one made of real black leather sorry i forgot this pete dropped down into his desk chair turning to face willis how d you do that impressive huh it s black magic he unfastened the black case reached inside but you ought to know all about that all about black magic listen mr willis i think maybe you call me chip chip i m commencing to think that you ve got the wrong peter whitlock he told him maybe you know you want some other peter whitlock peter j whitlock say or peter f whitlock or maybe no you re my boy pete he extracted a rolled sheet of parchment it was tied with a faded twist of red ribbon you remember this ca nt say i do what is it willis tapped his knee with the rolled parchment let me refresh your memory he offered frisco thirty years ago well thirty years less thirty days ago actually thirty years ago i was living out in san francisco yeah he admitted becoming aware of some twisting pains beginning deep in his stomach that was my first advertising job with arnold maxwell i started there as a copywriter just before my twentyfifth birthday but i do nt see what that has to do with it was there you began your impressive meteoric rise to success in your chosen profession meteoric pete laughed ruefully i ve been out of work for nearly five months i never rose above copywriter with any of the five agencies i ve worked with over the years i m living here in new beckford connecticut in a house that s dropped paying two vicious and vindictive former wives alimony and the last award i won was for some hounddog puppy treat trade ads back in he shook his head slowly success you ve definitely got the wrong peter whitlock chip let me clarify something offered willis a trace of impatience sounding in his voice because see lots of people i come to collect from try similar dodges but the point is success is relative and everybody ca nt become a flapping billionaire even the most powerful demon in the netherworld ca nt go around turning everybody into a millionaire hell that d futz up the economy worse than it is already collect what did you come to collect we ll get to that in a minute and what was that reference to demons oh cm on are you pretending you never heard of shug nrgyzb pete scowled at his visitor who i work for not a very catchy name for a company shug nrgyzb is nt a company or a product pete he s a demon explained willis waving the parchment a truly powerful one you re claiming you work for a demon i do work for a demon you really are a loon you d just better leave my whoa whoa pete i do nt have all that much time to waste untying the ribbon he unfurled the parchment the bottom line here is that you made a deal with shug nrgyzb thirty years back and now the time has come to settle the i never heard of him until just this minute insisted pete as he stood up again it s not the sort of name you d forget and trust me if i d made any deal with a demon granting that i would sure as hell remember it willis shook his head been tried pal what s been tried stupidity defense i was too dense to know what i was doing never works not ever the rep assured him possibly in a court of law you could pull something like that and have a chance but hey none of that cuts any ice with a demon pete sat you re claiming that thirty years ago out in san francisco i made some kind of deal with this shug nrgyzb you are nt pronouncing nrgyzb right pete it s nrgyzb be that as it may chip what was this deal i allegedly made in exchange for thirty years of uninterrupted success you agree to you call what i ve lived through for the past thirty years uninterrupted success do you have anything in your files on mary jo how can any man who was married to mary jo for ten long bleak years be considered a success you continue to miss the point pete if you had nt see made the deal things would ve been even worse the rep told him success for a schlep like you does nt involve sitting on top of the world for three decades nope it means rather that you and then there was mary jane my second wife were you aware that you have a tendency to marry women with similar names yeah but tell me what could have been worse than seven years with mary jane seven more with mary jo it s all i keep trying to convince you relative believe meyou ve had a much better life than you deserved do you know what my current bank balance is checking or savings savings in fairfield county people hereabouts give to their cleaning ladies as a christmas bonus they often drop into a homeless beggar s styrofoam cup they toss to their kids for pocket money believe me is not a fortune it sure as hell is not an impressive amount to have to show for thirty damn years of wild success for a born loser like you pete it s about more than you deserve he rattled the parchment at the same time making an impatient noise back to the business at hand it s our policy as you know to call on our clients thirty days in advance of the collection date that way pete you have time to put your affairs in order maybe arrange a farewell party do those things you ve always been meaning to do and being such a schlep never got around to doing wait now he was on his business where you come to collect my soul no it is not nope willis grinned all shug nrgyzb wants is your life life on your fiftyfifth birthday he ll appear and devour you pete sank slowly back into his desk chair what exactly does being devoured by shug nrgyzb involve painless really being as how he s on the large side he can devour the average person in two bites three tops promised willis some folks get panicky when they witness the flames and smoke that accompany a manifestation of shug nrgyzb but that s all for show you might possibly experience a few first degree burns but you ll only be alive for a few seconds after that anyway listen chip i never made any deal with this guy insisted pete so it really does nt seem fair particularly since i never actually to come and devour me i m sure that if you point out the mistake to him he ll be only too glad to actually shug nrgyzb has a reputation for being a real shit pete willis pointed out he could drop by and devour you merely for the fun of it yet that s a moot point since you did actually sign this document he paused scanning the parchment oops ha it is nt me you want at all is it oh it s you sure enough no doubt about that pete he held out the parchment you see the way this works is that the party who enjoys the success is the one who has to pay the piper in this particular instance however you did nt personally sign yourself up for the thirty year success package that was jennifer windmiller he d grabbed the bottom old girlfriend of yours as i understand it jennifer windmiller pete repeated softly as he let the parchment drop to the carpet i have nt thought of her for years willis rose up smoothing his trousers well you owe all the great things that have happened to you during your adult life to that little lady he said smiling we wo nt see each other again but it s been nice meeting you oh and do nt try to run when shug nrgyzb shows up to collect that would only make him madder and he d probably devour you in smaller bites there was a faint popping noise as willis his briefcase and the parchment all vanished zorina tashlin reached across the desk to brush at his left coat sleeve lint the thin dark woman mentioned perhaps your long stretch of unemployment peter is due as much to your slovenly appearance as qualify me as a slob he countered but let s get back to my latest problem she picked up her pencil set it down an inch to the right of where it had been i m a career consultant not a therapist no no i m not cracking up he assured her it s simply that i seem to be mixed up through no fault of my own with a vindictive demon perhaps if you accepted responsibility for your problems youd the reason i came by this afternoon zorina is that i need some advice about how to if you honestly believe that this old sweetheart of yours has put a curse on you then she s the one you must talk to it s not exactly a curse it was supposed to be a boon thirty years of ongoing achievement except it did nt turn out quite that way like jennifer windmiller why do nt you simply contact her peter i tried that soon as the demon s advance man vanished he answered trouble is she s not listed anywhere in the san francisco bay al sobotka has been driving a zamboni for the detroit res wings since how fast does a zamboni go around mph wow you drive that fast not too often the reason is you re trying to do a better job fill every skate mark but once in a while you step on it from one end to the other it makes your hair fly when you hit it you know is there special training required to drive a zamboni my training was all done on the job learning a lot of it by mistakes and from the guys who worked here in the past i always say i m still in training how do you spot rookie drivers oh god they just look straight ahead they do nt observe what s going on around them i look all the way around the surface to see if i missed a big ice gouge from a skate some people go once around the outside and then come up the middle but i like to go around twice ice no i do nt get into that at all the main concern is the quality of the ice if it takes an extra minute to do it that s fine but if there were a race i d win does blood clean up pretty easily yeah you got ta dryshave it firstclean it without water but if blood gets in the ice grooves it s hard to get out do you ever get asked for your autograph all the time kids mainly mr ilitch our owner asked me once in he had me sign a napkin for him i was privileged be honest is the zamboni a chick magnet it s a magnet for everybody chicks get excited just as much as little kids even men get excited by it rides are auctioned off for charities and at special events there have been functions that have gotten for a ride do the players ever give you props of visiting players say they wish their ice was as good if you get a compliment like that from eric lindros that s a good one guys who skate fast like

icefishing has a reputation as a slowaction slowtochange sport and to a certain extent that reputation is deserved dressed in the requisite spacesuit garb icefishermen move more like lunar explorers than michael jordan then there s the glacial pace of the handoverhand retrieve even the quarry is gripped by a lethargy that s only intermittently broken by tentative nips at baitsomething icefishermen hyperbolically call strikes e but icefishing s image is undergoing a total overhaul the last several years have seen a technological surge in every aspect of the sportfrom highspeed augers and nostretch jigging lines to powerful electronics that put the fish and your lure before your eyes here s how recent developments have changed the way we fish for winter s predators not long ago most walleye fishermen were hanging a live minnow from a float rattle reel or tipup but jigging baits have changed all that photograph are the days of the wooden tipup numbered with the technology race in full swing it live minnow anymore says minnesota icefishing guru dick the griz grzywinski i ll catch a dozen walleyes on a jigging bait for every one i catch on a minnow do nt use emthey re not worth the hassle he s referring of course to the timeconsuming chore of manually checking water depth then positioning bait just above bottom which also means that every time you move to a new hole the depth has to be reset and because some state laws require anglers to stay within a certain number of feet of their line that process is a huge drag on mobility stick with jigging obviously you ll want to focus your efforts over prime walleye structure like a sunken island a distinct point or the inside turn on a breakline in this capacity handheld gps units are enormous timesavers simply punch in your summertime walleye holes and begin there you ca nt just drill one hole and expect to adequately cover the this presents some obvious logisticaland laborproblems if you use a traditional auger which is why supersharp power augers are becoming so popular my personal favorite is the strikemaster lazer which is fitted with a unique curved blade that cuts a hole in half the time it takes any other auger i ve used instead of drilling a hole checking its depth then moving on as necessary until you find the desired depth there are now several handheld sounders that give depth readings through the ice the best one i ve found is the polar vision which is powerful enough to read through cloudy ice that other units ca nt penetrate or you might try getting a reading using the transducer of an ordinary depth finder just be sure to pour a little water on the ice to provide firm contact with the transducer if you watch a jigging expert work a piece of walleye structure you might think he s on a carpetbombing mission to the bottom the ice looks like swiss cheese but there s a method to his madness if you re working an to foot break for example drill a line of holes along the structure at and feet this pattern allows you to work your way around the structure at one depth then jump out to the next series of holes as the fish change their orientation walleyes may hold below the deeper holes at midday and then move shallower for the evening bite this way your holes are all set to go and you wo nt risk spooking the fish off the structure by drilling at sunset photograph the quickstrike rig stick the leading hook just ahead of the dorsal fin and the trailing hook near the pectoral fin photograph getting used to the circular reading has always been a problem for firsttime users of flasher units zercom has solved that problem with the introduction of the vertical flasher which as its name implies shows action the way it s really happening below you spoons like the vingla and swedish pimple swimming baits like the jigging rapala and vibrating blades like the cicada and heddon sonar even plain leadhead jigs tipped with a minnow or minnow head work my usual choice is a size swedish pimple in silver with a green or chartreuse back tipped with a minnow head use the entire minnow and you re liable to get short strikes the method is straightforward i use a sensitive inch graphite rod and a small spinning reel spooled with sixpound mono simply lower the spoon to the bottom reel it up to inches and then give it a gentle twitch hold the rod tip stationary as the spoon sinks on the twitchit will flutter out to the side before settling in the original position do nt jig again until the spoon has completely stopped movingmost strikes come after all movement has ceased a color flasher like the vexilar fl helps enormously with jig fishing a walleye hanging a few feet off to the side of the band or a thin red one but as the fish moves nearer to the bait the green band turns red or the width of the red band increases with a little experience you ll be able to interpret exactly what s going on beneath youwhether there are any fish how close they are which lure actions draw them in and when they re about to strike experiment with the force of your twitching and the length of the pauses in between until you find what the walleyes are looking for on a particular day twitch anywhere from three to six inches and wait seconds or so between each bounce watch the flasher closely to see how the fish are responding and adjust your action accordingly sometimes the best action is no action at allprop your rod up on a clump of snow and leave it just remember that mobility is the name of the game here if you jig a hole for five minutes and do nt see a fish or get a strike move rather cruise around until they find one hearty meal than chase down a dozen small snacks which means that while you may take an occasional pike by jigging you re much better off suspending a plump baitfish below a tipup the traditional bait is a lively five to seveninch sucker chub or shiner but pike are often more interested in dead baitfish particularly oily smelly ones like smelt or ciscoes why the interest in corpses not only do pike rely on scent more than any other predator fish when feeding but it does nt take a whole lot of energy to catch up to a cadaver the best way to rig dead bait on a tipup is on a quickstrike rig using a pair of double or treble hooks push one hook into the baitfish near the pectoral fin the other just in front of the dorsal fin this arrangement allows you to set the hook much quicker than with a dorsal or liprigged bait you ll land more fish and because you you ll have a better chance of successfully releasing fish you do nt want to keep use poundtest wire leader and a pair of size to treble hooks if you make your own quickstrike of the readymade tackle my favorite is the quickset rig the hooks are ultrasharp and the rear hook slides along the harness to accommodate any size baitfish set several baits to inches above the bottom in weedy bays around the edges of cabbage humps and in shallow backwaters that hold panfish if you strike out it does nt necessarily mean the fish are nt there it just means they re not at that depth pike will sometimes pick up dead bait right off the bottom at other times they prefer it hung only a foot under the ice the only constants are the two characteristics of your baitstinking and dead when in trout while most gamefish become sluggish in winter lake trout get lively under the ice it s not unusual to get one up powers right back to the bottom icefishing for lake trout has become a stickandmove sport timeconsuming bait rigs are out jigging is in i use a to ounce bucktail jig like the northland stingr bucktail in white or chartreuse tipped with a three to fourinch live shiner a dead cisco or smelt or a strip of cut bait such as herring or sucker if i m using cut bait or a minnow more than four inches long i add a stinger hook to account for short strikes when lakers are suspended off the bottom a video or liquidcrystal graph is invaluable for keeping track of the fish and your lure on the whole looking for lakers is rapidly turning into virtual fishing trout love to chase bait for example and you can often tempt a strike by reeling up quickly on my screen i ve seen the fish follow a bait from the bottom to just a few feet beneath the ice before taking it without good was happening most flashers do nt have the power to reach down the to feet where lakers lurka khz graph has to have at least watts of peaktopeak power i run a lowrance lms a graph off a amp motorcycle battery enough juice to get me through the day the unit

the hurricane will he weather the storm the media helping victims to weather the storm how did the media judge the judge how did audiences judge martha on her return to tv and everybody has to go to the bathroom sometime we will cover the coverage of these stories right after the headlines newsbreak burns you ve heard of slow times in the news business the past few weeks have been as fast as they get so we had better get started here are jim pinkerton of newsday syndicated columnist cal thomas jane hall of the american university and media writer neal gabler i m eric burns fox news watch is coming right up beginvideoclip georgewbushpre americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency when the federal government fails to meet such an obligation i as president am responsible for the problem and for the solution katrina thursday night jane a lot of the criticism about the media politicizing this storm but when the president of the united states apologizes himself are the media thereby absolved from criticism about politicizing janehallamerica you know that s an interesting question i think given that bush has been portrayed as being reluctant to remember when he had a mistake when he first said this at a press conference in response to a reporter s question when he said it again a lot of people i m sure his own advisers were telling him that the country the mood of the country was that he should take responsibility i do nt think that s politicizing i would fault the media in the commentary beforehand if i heard one more person say we re going to have a bullhorn moment referring to the apparently spontaneous moment down with the firemen in i thought that was cynical and uncalled for let the guy have his speech do nt talk there s a problem with the criticism at all i think that the administration on this issue had a tin ear he politically they made some very bad decisions but there s also as neal is found of saying and i think he s absolutely right on this there is a template in this coverage and one of the templates and there were many on this particular issue is that only big government is good and so if big government has failed as it clearly did at some level in this then the media jump right on what we really need is more money and more big government i find that to be inconsistent jimpinkerton ne right the further paradox is it s the big government is good but of course the federal government under bush is terrible so we have to we have to replace the current proprietor of the federal government bush with somebody better that s what they re are state and local governments to a substantial measure and of course the local populous which continues to get it to find itself whining all the time on tv to get more federal money crosstalk nealgablermedia there s so many ulterior motives going on burns well i was just going to say let s find out if there are more templates we ll go to the master gabler yes actually there is a template here it was very interesting the fall guy in this and the best story out of this was that michael brown was a complete moron you know there was they he should nt been in the position in the first place burns this is how the media portrayed him gabler exactly this is how the media portrayed him and in point of fact this is how the administration portrayed him as well now knightridder issues a report this week that indicates that the the one who should have taken command that in fact he did nt hand off the baton to brown until three days later now chertoff is a former judge chertoff seems to be respectable he s clearly intelligent it s a bad story to say that chertoff is the guy responsible it s a much better story to say that an idiot like brown is responsible burns so the media are sticking with that story pinkerton well they re fascinated by this and of course when a guy with a beard goes after another guy with a beard you know laughter pinkerton something huge is going on it s gabler versus chertoff but look without taking anything away from the terrible tragedy that occurred in new orleans we just moving to where we are in the media coverage of this this is now a completely a gift that s going to keep giving for years all these commissions all these tell who is going to be fodder for reporters for years to come crosstalk burns but jim it s not gabler well it may not be because look it one of the stories there are many stories that were nt covered this week one of the stories that was nt covered this week is that over percent of the american people want an independent commission the republicans on a straight party line voted down an independent commission on katrina barely that story was barely covered that s one of many stories that were nt covered nobid contracts burns jim refers jim refers to the story this story will keep on giving jane there s a way in which it s giving negatively and that is coverage abroad where the united states which was getting savaged in some countries for what it s doing in iraq is getting savaged all the more the economist a very highly of america and the foreign press is seizing upon this and i think in terms of future diplomatic efforts in all kinds of venues what the foreign press is now doing is going to have really serious ramifications hall you know i agree with you i was fairly shocked and i think it was designed to shock by the cover of a of a young africanamerican child and then the headline the shaming of america i think a lot of people frankly were indulging a lot of international coverage was indulging in the idea of well we re the biggest superpower we think we can help everybody we ca nt help our own people that script i think and the idea that we have a third world i saw that in a lot of international coverage right in our backyard crosstalk thomas the foreign media played the same racism game as the domestic media here s another template for you was when ted koppel who as who as anchoring the president s speech when to dean reynolds in the parking lot of the houston astrodome he had assembled africanamerican evacuees from new orleans he asked each one of them what they thought of the bush speech every one of them liked it every one said they had faith in bush every one would not criticize you could just see the sweat breaking out on his brow what have i got here so much for racism and anger against bush burns you know this is a hell of a time to admit it but i do nt know exactly what a template is time for a break

arrested for arson but you know it happens more than you might think the vast majority of those arrests are made among the ranks of volunteer firefighters these arsonists represent the dark side of a

and every home that got in the firefighters just weeks later in california a yearold forest service firefighter was arrested for setting five fires near san diego destroying homes and paralyzing a community in pennsylvania dozens of arsons terrorized the town of kennett square the culprit was not only a volunteer firefighter he was the son of the towns assistant chief in missouri a volunteer
