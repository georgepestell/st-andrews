Archive of files created for the completion of the University of St. Andrews Computer Science Integrated Masters (MSci).

To checkout files for a limited number of modules, it can be helpful to clone a sparse version of the repo using:

```bash
git clone --sparse --filter=blob:None https:github.com/georgepestell/st-andrews.git
```

Modules/files can then be added using:
```bash
git sparse-checkout add <relative-path>
```
